I recently got myself a new Macbook Air in anticipation for a trip I
was going on. I had been wanting to get a new dev laptop for a while
and was torn between the Air and a big Macbook Pro. Since i've been
traveling a lot more lately, I opted for the Air and I think that I
made a great decision. It's the perfect size for coding on an
airplane, its easy to pack, which is really important because i'm also
lugging around a tank of a ThinkPad around with me for work.

There has been one unanticipated consequence of this purchase,
however.  I noticed after the first day using the Macbook Air that I
was bothered by the noise when I sat down at one of my other machines
and listened to the electromechanical hard disk drives spin up and
whir. That sound had long ago been relinquished by my brain to the
periphery of my hearing. Now in a single day's span it was back, and
instead of reminding me of the good old days, learning to program
QBASIC on a 286 it was a nuisance.

I've been spoiled. Solid state drives are fast, quiet, and
[apparently prone to error](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/05/the-hot-crazy-solid-state-drive-scale.html). But
just likeJeff Atwood I won't be deterred by the downsides. The upsides
are just too good!
