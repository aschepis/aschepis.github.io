If the prospect of Facebook controlling access to all meaningful
social content on the internet isn't reason enough.. Here's some
more. A product manager for the Twitter platform put up a
[post](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/twitter-api-announce/yCzVnHqHIWo)
today about the future of the Twitter API. To make a long story short
he hammers home the desire for a uniform and consistent experience
across all applications that use Twitter and alleges that 3rd party
Twitter clients are confusing users by presenting them with
experiences that aren't the same as Twitter'sde factoexperience.

The most concise and cutting response I read regarding this stated
very simple: Different users have different needs. I couldn't agree
more. It seems like this is more motivated by monetization of the
platform than anything else.

Twitter owns all of your micro-blogging data. Yes, there are some
tools to archive it but how many people are dong this? They own the
protocol used to access the data, and they reserve the right to change
it or change who (or what applications) can access the data at any
time. Walled gardens aren't just about the information. They are about
the tools and mechanisms used to access the information. Aren't you
glad that we stopped using AOL's client and AOL's protocol?
Competition in technology for accessing information on the internet
has driven a ton of innovation in the browser and web-app spaces. This
competition is vital, in my opinion. Otherwise we will just stagnate.

I'm not the first person to say it, and there are people out there
trying to make it happen but I canforeseea time in the not too distant
future where we have micro-blogging and social networking sites whose
content is truly owned by the creators of the content. Platforms build
on open, standardized protocols. Platforms that encourage competition
and innovation. This is the direction we need to be moving in.
