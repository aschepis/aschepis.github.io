<div class="leading-loose mb-12 text-lg">
	<p>I was discussing some solutions with my co-workers recently and I was
advocating for one solution while some of my coworkers were advocating
for other solutions. The debate was good natured, but everybody felt
strongly about their opinions.</p>
<p>While the technical details of the proposed solutions were very
different, I also realized another key difference between the solution
I was proposing and one of the solutions that my coworker was fighting
hardest for. I was advocating for a solution that required development
complexity. It would be hard to maintain for a while (for reasons
having to do with legacy code and backwards compatibility) and we
would have to test it thoroughly. The other solution was less
challenging technically, but would require a lot more complexity from
an operational standpoint. Streaming data from one database to
another, making all the data in a DB that used to bewritableread-only,
monitoring the replication of data to make sure nothing goes wrong,
etc, etc.</p>
<p>I realized that given the alternative between development and
operational complexity I will almost always choose development
complexity. Here are a few reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can unit test code, Its harder to unit test a process.</li>
<li>It is easier to test code through traditional QA organizations than
it is to test an operations process that may only fail after a long
period of time or when some strange data that won&rsquo;t exist in test
data comes across.</li>
<li>If anything that can go wrong will go wrong, then I want to make
sure that when things go live there aren&rsquo;t many things that can go
wrong. That way I can have a plan in place to account for them prior
to going live.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, we hashed everything and came to a conclusion and we all
moved forward but it was interesting to see which people tend to favor
development complexity over operational complexity. As a developer,
what do you favor? why? My guess is that any developer who is into the
DevOps frame of mind would much rather development complexity for the
reasons I listed above. Developers working with a traditional IT
organization maybe more apt to throw it over the wall to IT and let
them manage it.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
