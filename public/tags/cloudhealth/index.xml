      <description>Today marks my 1 year anniversary at CloudHealth Technologies . This last year has been a whirlwind to say the least. While today marks the anniversary of my start date at CloudHealth the story actually begins several months earlier.
In 2014 I was working at Springboard Retail  who, I might add, are doing some awesome things in the retail space. On June 24, 2014 I got a message on Stack Overflow Careers  from a guy named Joe Kinsella  wondering if I might be interested in exploring opportunities at his startup.</description>

      <description>This morning at CloudHealth  we had the best sprint retrospective we&amp;rsquo;ve had during my entire tenure (5 months already!?) Let me tell you why.
The sprint itself was really productive. We delivered a lot of value to our customers, we responded promptly to customer issues, and we moved ourselves forward strategically. That being said, no codebase, process, product, or engineer is perfect. We&amp;rsquo;ve all go our strengths, weaknesses, tendencies, and pet peeves.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been at my new job at CloudHealth Technologies  for about two months now. I feel incredibly grateful to be able to work with such a talented team and to have the opportunity to tackle hard problems in an increasingly interesting space. Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a few things over the past 60 days now that i&amp;rsquo;ve switched from being a consumer of cloud services to a provider of value on top of cloud services.</description>
