Apologies if you've been having trouble reaching this blog. My post on
singletons got pretty popular and crashed my little EC2 instance a few
times. I'm going to have to look into a better hosting model,
perhaps. Scaling up with EC2 might be a bit pricey for a personal blog
with no advertisements. On the other hand... scaling up EC2 on the
cheap might make for a good blog post...
