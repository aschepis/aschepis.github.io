Getting back to blogging so I decided to add a fresh coat of paint
here. Instead of finding a template I decided to code my own site this
time. The design is heavily inspired by
[reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) but is my own code, so
when you find bugs you can blame me (and log a
[Github Issue](https://github.com/aschepis/aschepis.github.io/issues).)
Here is the stack i'm using for my blog these days:

- [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) for static site generation
- [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org) for dynamic aspects of the
  page
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) for stylesheets
- [Bower](http://bower.io) for pulling in client-side packages
- Hosting via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)

I've always enjoyed writing as a way to organize my thoughts or to at
least get them out of my head and away from my internal bias so i'm
very excited to be back at it.
