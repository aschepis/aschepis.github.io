Ok, so i'm starting to write a blog again. I've tried several other times only to have them fall by
the wayside. Why am i giving it another shot? A lot of it has to do with my belief that writing and
the ability to communicate ideas to others is an essential skill that has to be practiced.

The plan here is to mostly post about code, projects i'm working on, how i solved problems, and
perhaps some of my thoughts on other things more generally. Since my focus for this blog is to
write, I don't intend to fill this blog with link-spam or short posts that say "this is cool." If
i'm going to comment on something going on in the tech world it will be because I think I have
something new to say or a position worth stating.

Also -- who doesn't love a good argument so feel free to comment and agree or disagree with me. As
long as its good natured I will respond.
