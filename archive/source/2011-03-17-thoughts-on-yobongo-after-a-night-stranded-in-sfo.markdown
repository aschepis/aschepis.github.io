On a business trip this week a serious of unfortunate events
culminated with me being left in limbo in the San Franciscoairport
overnight. Like any self-respecting geek and optimist my first thought
was "Hey, this means I can spend a bunch of hours checking out
Yobongo!" For those not familiar with
[Yobongo](http://www.yobongo.com) it is a startup that is getting a
lot of hype lately. Their product, an eponymous iPhone app, is a
location-based group chat application. Currently it is only available
in a few cities (San Francisco, Austin (for SXSW), and New York.)

So how was the hot new thing? Honestly it let me down a bit. I have to
be fair though, it was late at night and there weren't many people
chatting. Having a room with more people would certainly have made it
more exciting.

That being said, I think that Yobongo's key weakness is the same as
its core strength. It is a mobile, location-based, group chat
application. This means i have to type on my iPhone to chat. This gets
old fast. Hopefully as the community grows some kind of shorthand
pidgin will form (like what happened with @ and # at Twitter) that
will make this less cumbersome. I also wonder if there isn't some
opportunity here to innovate in the space of textless chatting. It
would be interesting to see what kind of interactive chat-room style
environment you could make if you weren't allowed type (or could only
type 8-10 chars.) You would have the option of sharing photos (that
you could be taking at the moment) or use some less granular form of
language (i hate to say emoticons, but they are an example of the type
of thing i'm talking about.)

It's not all doom and gloom though. I think Yobongo would make a lot
of sense at events like SXSW and at conferences where you have a
community of people coming together who are interested in chatting and
knowing whats going on. Twitter can do this, but Yobongo does a better
job of keeping it in the vicinity of the action. I just can't see it
working too well in many areas though. Sure it might work in NY, SF,
and at SXSW but will it work in Hartford, CT? How about a small town
in Missouri?

It will be interesting to see how Yobongo evolves and expands into
other communities. I didn't like Twitter at first either.. but now I
"get it." Maybe i'll have the same experience with Yobongo. Maybe not.
