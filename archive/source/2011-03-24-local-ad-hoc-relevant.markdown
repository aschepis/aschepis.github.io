A couple posts ago I wrote about my
[rather disappointing first experience](/2011/03/17/thoughts-on-yobongo-after-a-night-stranded-in-sfo/")
with [Yobongo](http://yobongo.com). Yesterday I saw that Robert Scoble
unleashed a rant about how terrible his first experience with the
also-hyped app [Color](http://color.com/) was.This led me
to check out what Color was about and it got me thinking about what
the trends and factors are that are helping to feed the hype machines
for, and in the case of the bubbleiciously well-funded Color, lining
the pockets of, these two startups.

After a while it came to me that these two startups are tapping into
the same three things. Local. Ad-hoc. Relevant.

Yobongo is mobile group chat tied to your city. It's local. It's
ad-hoc because the participants come and go as they please. And it's
supposed to provide you with relevant information (e.g. What's the
best place to eat downtown?) from locals who know.

Color is local. You pair up with nearby people in what they call a
"moving social network." It's ad-hoc because your network can change
as you move from place to place. And it's relevant because the videos
and pictures you and your network are taking are of the same thing at
the same time in the same place (just from a different perspective.)
The scenario that exemplifies this the best is a concert or sporting
event. You could be creating a stream or album of pictures and video
from the event taken from all sort of different views (up in the
luxury box, down on the first base line, behind the catcher, etc.)
Heck, you might even see yourself in some strangers photo (so behave!)

Local. Ad-hoc. Relevant. A pretty compelling trio even if you aren't
fans of the two apps listed above. My next thought was that there are
a ton of successful web companies out there right now that have two of
these things, but not all three.

[Groupon](http://www.groupon.com): Local, Relevant.

[Foursquare](http://www.foursquare.com): Local, Relevant, (kind of
ad-hoc, but they could add some functionality here)

[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com): Relevant, with some ad-hoc if
you're searching, and some local stuff if you're narrowing in on
tweets in a particular location.

So are we going to see more apps converging around the concepts of
local, ad-hoc, and relevant? Is there room to innovate here? What is
the NEXT thing once people get all three?
